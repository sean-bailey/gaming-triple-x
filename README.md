# gaming-triple-x
This repo is to hold my code and learnings for developing a C++ Game from the Udemy Unreal C++ Course

This starts with `tripleX.cpp`. To get things going, compile and run that code using 

`cl ./tripleX.cpp` 

to generate the executable. Once done, you'll have `tripleX.exe` which can be run. Run it (currently in the command line) and enjoy the game!
